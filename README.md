# Haste

Haste is an open-source pastebin software written in node.js, which is easily
installable in any network.  It can be backed by either redis or filesystem,
and has a very easy adapter interface for other stores.  A publicly available
version can be found at [hastebin.com](http://hastebin.com)

Major design objectives:

* Be really pretty
* Be really simple
* Be easy to set up and use

Haste works really well with a little utility called
[haste-client](https://github.com/seejohnrun/haste-client), allowing you
to do things like:

`cat something | haste`

which will output a URL to share containing the contents of `cat something`'s
STDOUT.  Check the README there for more details and usages.

## Tested Browsers

* Firefox 8
* Chrome 17
* Safari 5.3

## Installation

1.  Download the package, and expand it
2.  Explore the settings inside of config.js, but the defaults should be good
3.  `npm install`
4.  `npm start` (you may specify an optional `<config-path>` as well)

## Settings

* `host` - the host the server runs on (default localhost)
* `port` - the port the server runs on (default 7777)
* `keyLength` - the length of the keys to user (default 10)
* `maxLength` - maximum length of a paste (default 400000)
* `staticMaxAge` - max age for static assets (86400)
* `recompressStaticAssets` - whether or not to compile static js assets (true)
* `documents` - static documents to serve (ex: http://hastebin.com/about.com)
  in addition to static assets.  These will never expire.
* `storage` - storage options (see below)
* `logging` - logging preferences
* `keyGenerator` - key generator options (see below)
* `rateLimits` - settings for rate limiting (see below)

## Rate Limiting

When present, the `rateLimits` option enables built-in rate limiting courtesy
of `connect-ratelimit`.  Any of the options supported by that library can be
used and set in `config.js`.

See the README for [connect-ratelimit](https://github.com/dharmafly/connect-ratelimit)
for more information!
